A recent graduate of the University of Michigan Engineering Nexus Full Stack Academy Bootcamp, I am certified in Immersive Software Engineering and Web Development. With a background in audio engineering and performing arts technology, I bring a creative and technical approach to problem-solving. I have genuine passion for technology, willingness to learn and grow. My experience as a creative producer has honed my ability to develop innovative ideas and execute projects with precision both independently and collaboratively. Passionate about technology and storytelling, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and engineering.
